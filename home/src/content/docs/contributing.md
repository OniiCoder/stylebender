## Reporting bugs

If you are finding issues using stylebender, please [create an issue](https://github.com/blackmann/stylebender/issues) to let us know. Before creating an issue, please check if one doesn't exist already.

When creating an issue, it helps to share steps to reproduce your problem - best if you can share a screen recording.

## Proposing changes or features

You can [create an issue](https://github.com/blackmann/stylebender/issues) to propose change or features too. Please have in mind that stylebender does not aim to be the solution to all design and styles problem. The framework is to be simple and easy to get setup. If you are unsure, you can propose anyways. There's no harm!

## Submitting PRs

Before submitting PRs, please create an issue first. Unless it's a trivial change like typos or bug fixes with few lines of code. Creating an issue first before attempting to work on it will allows us to discuss decisions involved before you put in significant work which can be rejected.

If an issue already exists and you'll like to work on it, please start a discussion under that issue and mention [@blackmann](https://github.com/blackmann) to begin discussion.
